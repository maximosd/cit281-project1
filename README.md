UO CIT 281 - Project 1

# Project: 
Project 1 kickstarted our CIT 281 journey. This project focused on building understanding of the command line interface (CLI) and its functionalities. We learned how to navigate the CLI, execute commands, and manage files and directories. We started by experimenting with commands to make a tree file structure. Then, we experimented with the ping functionality to test network connectivity. Finally, we were required to create JS file that would output the day of the week for the current date. We used this requirement to practice with the built-in debug functionality in VS Code.

# Lab: 
Lab 1 focused on setting up our coding environment on our personal computers. We installed some useful extensions in VS Code, as well as used the integrated terminal to install git. We also used this lab to practice using basic inline commands such as 'mkdir', 'cd', and 'ls' to navigate the file system.
