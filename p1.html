    <h4 class="contentHeaders">The Project</h4>
    <p class="projectDescription">
        Project 1 kickstarted our CIT 281 journey. This project focused on
         building understanding of the command line interface (CLI) and its
        functionalities. We learned how to navigate the CLI, execute commands,
        and manage files and directories.

        We started by experimenting with commands to make a tree file structure. Then,
        we experimented with the ping functionality to test network connectivity.
        Finally, we were required to create JS file that would output the day of the
        week for the current date. We used this requirement to practice with the built-in
        debug functionality in VS Code.

    <h4 class="contentHeaders">Lab 1</h4>
    <p class="labDescriptions">
        Lab 1 focused on setting up our coding environment on our personal computers.
        We installed some useful extensions in VS Code, as well as used the integrated
        terminal to install git. We also used this lab to practice using basic inline commands
        such as 'mkdir', 'cd', and 'ls' to navigate the file system.
    </p>
    <h4 class="contentHeaders">Lab 2</h4>
    <p class="labDescriptions">
        Lab 2 built off of Lab 1. We initialized git using 'git init', and then new file to
        this git Repository. Next, we went through the process of adding and comitting files.
        Along with this, we practiced using '.gitignore' to ignore files that we did not want to commit.
        Additionally, we learned how clone cloud repos locally. We also practiced branching 
        these repos to test new features.
